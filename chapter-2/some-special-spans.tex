\section{Some special spans}

If $x$ is a vector in $\V$, what is the intersection of all the subspaces of $\V$ that contain $x$? (Caution: are there any?) In view of Problem 24, one thing is for sure: that intersection, call it $\M$, is a subspace. Since, moreover, $\M$ is the intersection of sets (subspaces) each of which contains $x$, it too contains $x$. What else does it contain? Answer: since a subspace containing $x$ must contain all scalar multiples of $x$, it follows that $\alpha x$ is in $\M$ for every $\alpha$. The set $\M_0$ of all scalar multiples of $x$ is itself a subspace, and the preceding sentence says exactly that $\M_0 \subset \M$. Since, moreover, the subspace $\M_0$ contains $x$, so that it is a member of the collection that was interesected to form $\M$, it follows that $\M \subset \M_0$. Consequence: $\M = \M_0$.

The same argument can be applied to two vectors as easily as to one. If $x$ and $y$ are in $\V$, there surely exist subspaces that contain them both ($\V$ is one), and the intersection of all those subspaces is a subspace $\M$ that contains both. Being a subspace, it contains all linear combinations $\alpha x + \beta y$ also.
